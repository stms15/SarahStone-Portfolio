# Sarah Stone's Portfolio

## Description

This webpage is a personal portfolio showcasing the work I've done. You can browse my site to learn more about me, review my previous projects, and contact me.

The goal is to make my experience and expertise as a developer easily accessible, and to provide helpful links and information to those who want to reach out.

This website currently only uses HTML and CSS. While building, I learned more about flexboxes, hover actions, and responsive elements.

The navigation bar in the header section can be used to quickly go to each section on the page. Hovering over one of the section names in the bar will cause the text to expand. When clicked, the page will scroll to the associated section.

You can learn more about me, my background, and my interests in the "About Me" section. The "Previous Work" section contains clickable screenshots of my current or past projects. When clicked, these will open the corresponding project in a new tab. You can find information on how to contact me directly or through my socials in the "Contact" section.

A screenshot of the entire website can be seen below.
